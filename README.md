# NeverMuseFocus
Android app that connects with the Muse The Brain Sensing Headband. Will notify you when falling asleep

This project was developed in under 36 hours at a Hackathon at FSU in 2016. 

This application uses the Muse SDK to connect via bluetooth to the Muse headband which records brain data

in the form of waves such as Beta, Gamma, Theta, etc... 

This data was analyzed and then relayed to an algorithm taking account time intervals between flunctuations

of wave data, and relative calculations of the Gamma wave to know when to notify.
